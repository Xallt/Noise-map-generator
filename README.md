# Noise-map-generator
Online noise texture generator. Check out at https://xallt.github.io/Noise-map-generator/


# Description
The initial noise texture is created by summing up [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) with different weights resulting in **Fractal noise**.

Then a texture generated by the same algortihm is used for distortion.

# Parameters

|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Resolution**|The resolution with which the texture will be downloaded|
|**Channels**|How many different noise textures to use in the output texture. Setting this to 3 will result in the image contaning 3 different noise textures in **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** channels|
|**Octaves**|Number of iterations for Fractal noise|
|**Scale**|Scaling factor for Perlin noise|
|**Gain**|How much more the next iteration affects|


**Channels** - How many different noise textures to use in the output texture. Setting this to 3 will result in the image contaning 3 different noise textures in **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** channels

### Initial perlin noise

**Octaves** - number of iterations
